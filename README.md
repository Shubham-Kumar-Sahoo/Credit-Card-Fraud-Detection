# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project, we're building a deep neural network-driven credit card fraud detection system to swiftly identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, enhancing security and minimizing financial losses. Through meticulous data preprocessing, analysis, and model training, our aim is to create a robust solution that bolsters transaction security while reducing false positives.

## Requirements

To install the required python libraries, execute the following command in the terminal :-  
-pip install -r requirments.txt

## To Run

1. Open app.py and execute it. Now the backend server is live
2. Now go to frontend and open the terminal
3. Run the following commands in the terminal :-
   
   i. yarn
   ii. yarn run dev
4. Now open localhost server
5. Then enter the transaction details in csv format and check whether the transaction is fraud or not
